# api.eauw.org

A web API to facilitate automations and services relevant to our organization including adding emails to the mailing list, sending emails, and reading calendar events. Co-authored with Eeshaan Pirani.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

#### Create an `.env` file

``` sh
cp .env.example .env
```

#### Google Service Account Credentials

1. Create a new project in the Google Cloud Console. 
2. Enable the Admin SDK API, the Google Spreadsheets API, and other APIs as needed.
3. Create a new service account and export the JSON credentials.
   - A valid JSON will have `"type": "service_account"` as the first key-value pair. 
4. Set the environment variable `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` to the path of the JSON.

> Note: API calls can only be made if the "subject" field in the body is set to an admin of the Google Workspace. Set `GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_ADMIN_ACCOUNT` to the email address of an admin in your workspace.

#### SMTP Credentials

Set the environment variables `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_USER`, and `SMTP_PASS`. By default, the application uses port 465 for secure transfer. It can be changed in `processes/confirmationEmail.process.ts` if needed.

#### Set resources
1. Set the environment variable `SPREADSHEET_ID` to the ID of the Google Spreadsheet you'd like to append to.
2. Set the environment variable `GROUP_ID` to the ID of the Google Group you'd like to add members to.
